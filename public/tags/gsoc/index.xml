      <description>This blog post showcases what I did last week and what I plan to do next.
Work Done This Week : 1. JPEG or PNG?   Last week I was able to convert the .tif files from the cell-tracking-challenge dataset into NumPy arrays. The next goal was to save these NumPy arrays as image files.
  Here&amp;rsquo;s where I made a mistake, I saved the images as .jpeg files.</description>
