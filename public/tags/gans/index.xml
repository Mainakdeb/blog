      <description>GANs can generate real-looking samples, but can they be trained to generate conditioned samples? The answer is yes. This blog post documents my learning experience with Conditional GANs and attempts to explain how I was able to generate images of class-specific handwritten digits. The digits you see above are not real, they are generated using a PyTorch based Conditional DCGAN, I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared a colab notebook, feel free to check it out by clicking the badge below.</description>

      <description>This gif showcases generated samples from a GAN trained on the MNIST dataset. Link to project repository.
Background : Last saturday, I was browsing YouTube on my phone when the algorithm suggested me a video on GANs by Computerphile. Until that point I had a vague idea of what GANs were, mostly derived from conversations with my brother, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know how they worked.
Anyways, I watched the whole video and was heavily impressed by the whole notion of making computers generate new real-looking data.</description>
