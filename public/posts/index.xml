      <description>Work Done This Week (July 5th to July 12th)  Refactored the training loop for the nucleus segentation model, this enabled faster prototyping and experimentation. Integrated Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization. Ran 200 optuna trials to find training hyperparams. Optuna samples hyperparams from a given range, which in this case was -  Learning rate: 0.5e-3 to 20e-3 Batch Size: 8 to 64   Each trial trained the model on 10% of available data for 3 epochs, and returned the resulting IOU score.</description>

      <description>Most of my time this week was spent on building the training pipeline for the proposed cell nucleus segmentation model in C. elegans embryos.
Work Done This Week (June 28th to July 4th)   Back in week-1, I had worked on preprocessing data from the cell-tracking-challenge dataset. The dataset was extracted from .tif files and saved as pairs of .png files.
  To prevent anu CPU bottlenecks while training, I used PIL to resize all the training images to 1x256x256 beforehand.</description>

      <description>Work Done This Week (June 21st to June 27th)   Converted the upgraded segmentation model into ONNX format.
  Ran inference on the ONNX model (colab and local environment) to make sure it works. Then used Gradio to build a GUI.
  The next step was to host this online. Gradio has their own hosting service, but that costs $7/month. Looked into ways of hosting apps online for free, decided to go with Heroku.</description>

      <description>The goal for this week was to upgrade the DevoLearn cell membrane segmentation model. Feel free to check out the code - Link
Work Done This Week (June 14th to June 20th) 1. Fixed the Preprocessing Pipeline:  Fixed a strange issue that led to an offset in the image filenames. Used PNG format to store the images instead of JPG (which was being used). The JPG format led to lossy edges in segmentation maps, which was being tackled using OpenCV based operations, but that led to larger gaps between the segmentation maps of individual cells.</description>

      <description>This blog post showcases what I did last week and what I plan to do next.
Work Done This Week (June 7th to June 13th) 1. JPEG or PNG?   Last week I was able to convert the .tif files from the cell-tracking-challenge dataset into NumPy arrays. The next goal was to save these NumPy arrays as image files.
  Here&amp;rsquo;s where I made a mistake, I saved the images as .</description>

      <description>This blog post summary of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this week and what I plan to do in the coming week.
Work Done This Week (May 17th to June 6th)   Gave a presentation on the weekly DevoWorm meeting, discussed the goals and deadlines that need to be met in the coming months - link to the slides
  Read some articles/papers suggested by my mentor that deal with working with communities and collaboration, liked one in particular that talks about &amp;ldquo;bursty&amp;rdquo; communication and how it helps remote teams thrive - link</description>

      <title>The Next Step - Conditional DCGANs</title>

      <description>GANs can generate real-looking samples, but can they be trained to generate conditioned samples? The answer is yes. This blog post documents my learning experience with Conditional GANs and attempts to explain how I was able to generate images of class-specific handwritten digits. The digits you see above are not real, they are generated using a PyTorch based Conditional DCGAN, I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared a colab notebook, feel free to check it out by clicking the badge below.</description>

      <description>This gif showcases generated samples from a GAN trained on the MNIST dataset. Link to project repository.
Background : Last saturday, I was browsing YouTube on my phone when the algorithm suggested me a video on GANs by Computerphile. Until that point I had a vague idea of what GANs were, mostly derived from conversations with my brother, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know how they worked.
Anyways, I watched the whole video and was heavily impressed by the whole notion of making computers generate new real-looking data.</description>
