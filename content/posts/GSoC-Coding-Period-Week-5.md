## Work Done This Week (July 5th to July 12th)

* Refactored the training loop for the nucleus segentation model, this enabled faster prototyping and experimentation.
* Integrated Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization. Ran 200 optuna trials to find training hyperparams.
* Optuna samples hyperparams from a given range, which in this case was -
    * Learning rate: 0.5e-3 to 20e-3
    * Batch Size: 8 to 64
* Each trial trained the model on 10% of available data for 3 epochs, and returned the resulting IOU score.
* The hyperparams from the best optuna trial is shown in the image below

* As a recap, the model details are :
    * Type - Feature Pyramid Network
    * Backbone - ResNet-18

* Trained the model for 50 epochs, the training metrics are showcased below.

* The model seems to perform well, even when the inputs are super noisy/underexposed. The GIF below shows model predictions on 2D slices of 3D data at one point in time.

## Planned:
* Build a GUI for the online demo.
* Add this model to the DevoLearn library.
* Swap out the existing DevoLearn cell membrane segmentation model with the new upgraded model.
